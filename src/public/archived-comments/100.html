Thank you. I have some questions.
1. What if a process change its Window Station? If the process is a gui app, the application can't display gui anymore?
2. If so, when should we change Windows Station? I haven't ever used the Apis. What processes are in Windows Station1~N?
3. What happen when we do logoff an acount. Will the Session and Window Station, Desktop, Process be destroyed?
What if we log on again as same account?</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02afa7bad895d2a23ba54e6a41dc626c?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="">He Zhiqiang</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">This post helps me a lot. Thank you!

In the 4th paragraph of the Windows Stations section, the first sentence "There is one special Window Station called Winsta0 for every station", I think it should be "There is one special Window Station called Winsta0 for every session".

A question: Since only the WinStat0 can display UI to the user, why should the other stations have Desktop inside? As you have described, this stations has no chance to display UI anyway.
