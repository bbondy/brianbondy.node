I too believe Stack Overflow goes overboard with the `nofollow` attribute.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4211de086d5a600e6a613ed8fcef3d?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="">Cyril Gupta</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Considering that SO has community generated content, it makes sense for it to give back to the generators.

Why Jeff uses WikiPedia as some kind of totem with which to set a standard is beyond me. SO is a Q&amp;A site, WikiPedia is an encyclopaedia there is no comparison other than that there is a wiki-style editor.

The "nofollow" thing truly annoys me and as a frequent visitor (as in I use it every day, almost all day, was a beta user) I rarely see these big spam problems or self-commercial promotion by high-rep users (by that I mean 10-15k+) that Jeff alludes to.

Additionally the community is pretty quick to slap down spam, there's a good self-policing thing going on there.

I continue to use SO because it's a great site and has a great hardcore community that does a good job of maintaining a reasonably high standard. However I have long flipped the bozo bit on Jeff and his wacky ideas, throttling mechanisms and idiotic ideas about email that just get in the way of experienced users going about their business. It's a symptom of Jeff's head no longer being able to fit through his door due to his superstar status. This isn't helped either by the circle of sycophants who prop up his ego in the hope of somehow becoming a moderator or becoming a "valued associate".

I think nofollow could reasonably be removed for users of 10 or 15k+. Let's face it, if you've reached that level of rep then you're an active participant and most likely a good citizen.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.cannonade.net/dev" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bb5f2493a0683f05729bfd93c4c8636?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.cannonade.net/dev">Tom Horn</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Thanks for the post Brian.

I agree 100%. No follow links are not being used with big sites and content farms like crazy so they can either gain Google PR and/or use content from a non-spam-quality-site and not loose link juice. I'm dealing with it in spades on my sites. Total BS. Thanks again for the great post.

Or downgrades that site. Or something else. Anyways, the major point is, you aren't going to change the behavior of thousands of sites unless it either penalizes them or at the very least doesn't benefit them. The onus is on search engines to figure this out. It's their job.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a15cc3b03fe7e914a5261d38a0442d8?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://blog.preinheimer.com">Paul Reinheimer</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I've been pondering my own blog post for a while.

I see a steady trickle of users to various blog posts of mine from StackOverflow on a few topics, which I enjoy. But I find it offensive that while their users can reference my work as the source of their answers, search engines are specifically blocked from leveraging this.

In one of the meta posts they talked about the tragic results of turning it back on for a while, search engine traffic dropped. In my mind this was the expected result! Once all the various sites that provided great answers were given their due, they started ranking better than SO.


Once I discovered all this, my interest in answering questions on SO, and participating in that ecosystem dropped precipitously. </p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc788866a2c18472d2fb4a2139ed989?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">coconutstudio</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">I agree with nofollow becoming the standard for all links.

It's not a promotional site, and if you feel "put out" by having your link to your site nofollowed then you need to reconsider why you feel it's a bad thing that Stack do it.

The very fact people complain it's nofollow, and people here feel put out by it and your blog page complains about it, proves nothing other than people would just post on Stack for the sake of getting their backlink and some PageRank. 
How is this useful or relevant to a site which offers advice and help for programming questions?

If the world was fair, then you and others posting here would already be answering and a bonus would be your links were followed. However the bleak truth is spammers and auto-spamming-bots would flock in their thousands and degrade the site.

Stack's sites are to give information, and if the world suddenly found out all links on Stack sites were no longer nofollow, the spam, crap questions, and very poor answers would flow freely and in great numbers.

This would degrade the site and remove the very reason it is such a great site, the fact it concentrates on quality answers and questions, and not other crap the internet is already full of.

Some people don't like the strict rules and policies Stack follow, and often I disagree with some things, but strict rules are needed when you have tens of millions of users, otherwise it becomes messy and disorganised.
Same with nofollow. It stops the spammers and thus maintains quality content as much as possible.




I also find it quite ironic that your page here talks about how a huge site with tens of millions of users wont allow follow links which would in truth open themselves up to a mass spam attack, yet your links here in comments, on a small less known site, are... nofollow....
