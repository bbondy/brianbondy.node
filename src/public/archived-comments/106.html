They went from one extreme (far too expensive and not very good - SE never pace with the SO codebase) to the Area51 "incubation" thing where, lets face it, a noisy minority of [M]SO users decide on whether a proposal is any good.

Jeff and Joel really need to get off their arrogant high horses ("making the internet a better place" - meh) and realise that they are never going to appeal to folks outside of the [M]SO clique unless they lower the barrier for entry.

The whole Area51 process is an utter f***ing joke and makes me weep. I wonder how long their VC's will allow this to carry on.

I referred a couple of internet savvy foodie pals to the cooking site, they took one look and decided not to participate. When I asked why, they felt that there were too many "bolt counters", self appointed officials and the whole thing seemed like a bunch of basement nerds writing a science paper on cooking. I myself participated for a while (I'm a long term SO user so I grok the rules) but felt there were far too many "Meta" types trying to call the shots on whether my questions were "subjective". I mean FFS, cooking, flavouring, tasting...these are all subjective. I gave up.

Why they can't accept that what people really want is a tenner a month (rising sensibly based on realistic resource consumption) hosted Q&amp;A service with all the frills of SO and without some officious w*nkers from MSO (and I mean the ones who clearly have no interest in "community" but like making rules - the ones who have stupidly high MSO rep, but barely participate in the sites themselves) poking their noses in. 

How hard can that be to provide? Maybe it's time that Jeff and Joel are sidelined because they sure aren't coming up with any "great" ideas of late?

Sure there is excellent content and advice, but is the goal helping the users or the site? If we continue to persecute "bad" questions with this kind of zealousness where will we end up?

I take offense to the "expert level" criteria â€“ not everyone is an expert and they should not be expected to be anyways. </p></li></ul>
