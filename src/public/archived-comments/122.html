I too would have liked to have included the final release of IE9 in my book, but every delay could mean that another part of the book would become slightly outdated. If it were up to me I would have kept on revising it, but the publisher insisted we set a cut-off point!

I've got more up-to-date information on the website which supports the book, http://thebookofcss3.com, which I hope is an acceptable compromise.</p></li></ul>
