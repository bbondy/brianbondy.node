I did a long time ago an application updater, that worked this way.

1) The application executable downloaded the update files
2) The next restart the application if it find those files it start the service (and as I said, it can be started by any user)
3) the service checked signatures of the update filesl, install them and exists
4) the application continue its startup procedure

this way the Updater Service is not a long running process, It only runs when the update is being applied</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://davidnaylor.org/blog/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b53ac440869db5bf7248ae5c6d26b1c3?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://davidnaylor.org/blog/">David Naylor</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Thanks for the detailed post.

That sounds suspiciously like those processes Java, Open Office and a million other applications sneakily install to slow down your OS boot (because no one will ever notice that, right, and if they do, they'll just blame Microsoft instead of us), in order to marginally speed up "our" software. Please think thrice before embarking on something like that.

Re: Starting the service on demand.  That sounds like a great idea and I'll look into doing this.

Re jalf on prefetch bloat: Other uses of the service is purely speculative right now and slowing down the system is the absolute last thing we'd ever let ship in the product.  Thanks for the insight though, it's appreciated. The thing I wanted to try in particular was loading the DLLs that we're already loading for the service via memory from the app instead of from disk.  So a custom built LoadLibrary that works from memory instead of disk.

As far as I remember I've installed Fx from admin login. 
Anyway, when work on Windows, I do it on luser account of course.
When Firefox prompts about update (or when I trigger it through Help &gt; About dialog) it DOESN"T ask for elevated permission (no UAC dialog). Instead it just runs installation, but as I suppose into pure "virtual" version of Program Files.
What mechanism is Firefox supposed to use? elevated ShellExecute or manifest with run=requireAdministrator (these are the only two I know they work, but I am not expert).
There is no problem when you install Firefox without elevated right, it just goes to AppData on user profile and works from there as usual. Problem exist only when you install from admin and try to update on common user.
That's not real problem for me, as I prefer Ubuntu (and I've learned about issue now), but it can stop common users from updating at all! They get all prompts, but no real update at all.
If you need more informations or I can be any help, you may contact me by email or xmpp (jid the same as email).</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

Chrome was mentioned above about how other software does software updates, but it does not apply to us because we install by default into Program Files unlike Chrome.
The Windows scheduler cannot be used to automatically gain elevated permissions.  
As per the above comments we are going to try only starting the service when it is needed and then stop it again.

I wouldn't call this a sneaky change as it is a public change, and it is optional.  
Spyware is a type of software that monitors what you do on your computer and then relays that information to someone else over the Internet.
This service will clearly not do that, and you are free not to have it on your computer. 

Our intent is only to not annoy users, Mozilla is non-profit organization and the one web browser on the Internet that you can trust above all others.

Random comment on updating on shutdown... It might be interesting to look at ways of applying most of the update _while_ you're running (eg to an inactive staging directory), so that there's just minimal work left to actually apply the update. Then it doesn't really matter if that's done on launch or shutdown, because it would be extremely fast.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6093b232c50595eed16dccc6fcf92c03?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">paulo995</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Hello.

I think it will apply there if you install as a limited user account.

We will be scheduling a security review this week on the project to ensure we're on the right track and that we're thinking of everything.

This is not correct from what I understand. Scheduled tasks may run with elevation, see http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/run-programs-elevated-without-getting-the-uac-prompt/ for an example or the description of the "Run with highest privileges" option in TechNet (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722152.aspx)

If you made your decision to implement an update service based on the assumption that this was the only way to bypass the UAC prompt, then I'd be glad if you reconsider that decision. 

Anything that does not rely on yet another update service permanently up and running with full privileges will be much better. </p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com/">Brian R.

&gt; ... Scheduled tasks may run with elevation ...

Right I didn't say they can't run elevated, just that they can't be used as a trick to run elevated for unelevated processes.
There are other UX issues at hand with that approach that would be needed when setting up the schedule.

&gt; Anything that does not rely on yet another update service permanently up and running with full privileges will be much better.

I think we'll only start it when needed and shut it down again right, so it will have no overhead on system performance. </p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6093b232c50595eed16dccc6fcf92c03?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">paulo995</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">&gt;&gt; "I think it will apply there if you install as a limited user account."

I use Fx because of certain extensions.

I always use a limited account when browsing because this does  not allow installation of malwares (except if they escalate their access rights using a vulnerability). Apparently Mozilla ignore this security rule... The only problem is that precludes the present update program of Mozilla products !
In some cases I am in a hurry to do or finish a work or to leave my PC and cannot accept to be delayed by the update process... In other cases I am idle and wish to update immediately at full speed...
So I don't wish to have an automatic update without my control ! My favourite solution is to have the update loaded in the back ground by the limited account in a place known to the admin account and some information permanently shown on the FF when an update is ready, to have a way to check compatibility of extensions before installation of the update, and when I wish to disconnect from the net and do installation from the admin account.
If it is not possible I wish to have a command to update immediately at full speed from the admin account to be connected for the shortest possible duration.
A newsletter or about:mozilla is sufficient to make me aware of a new release...</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

You can configure this to do everything you want already, and in the future via the preferences.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20e5f175be64ca2151a7624824b1faa5?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">laszlo</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">&gt;&gt; ... Scheduled tasks may run with elevation ...

&gt; Right I didn't say they can't run elevated, just that they can't be used as a trick to run elevated for unelevated processes.

It's not a way for a process to auto-elevate itself, that's right. But nonetheless you should take a look at the schtasks.exe utility coming with Windows Vista and 7. It's able to start a previously defined elevated task from an unelevated process.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b31a3a246475e4b51ba553ce14c8190?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">ccaporale</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Brian-
Great work, I look forward to it.  You've now saved me the time of having to write the service myself (literally I was going to start it next week).  I will offer one suggestion, though.  One of my design requirements was to use a local intranet AUS for updates and addons.  That way, sysadmins (and us Information Security nazis) have the ability to review and approve updates.  Additionally, that would give us control of what corporate-approved addons could be installed, as well as reduce the bandwidth as thousands of computers attempted to hit mozilla's AUS at the same time.
Now, how we populate the local AUS is a different story.  A Mozilla Corporate Update Repo Application would be pretty cool, but I was just planning on using an at job and WGET.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7202429487592f26b3c6c97c0c079d2f?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">mrgreen</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">I wanted to mention this to the developers of the silent update service - if the service ever attempts to connect to the internet, firewalls will block it and it will be unreliable.  If the download is done by the browser and then the updating is done by the background service that should work much better.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://ww.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://ww.brianbondy.com">Brian R.
