I'm sure that the problem is a lot more complicated than I think it is, but are the reasons for not doing this technical, or maybe also philosophical? Because as a user, I know I really don't care what "dirty" tricks have been used, or what the measured startup time is, as long as the startup *feels* faster.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2b625f331361a7110da59a907d79e95?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">JulienW</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Are there measurements made on the installed base of Firefox like what is done for memory usage ?</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

I think early window loading is already done for Firefox on mobile, but ya that might be possible on Desktop as well.  I'd prefer to work on real speed opts that do less work or deffer work until after startup on another non-main thread though.  But this is something we can look into after those optimizaitons are all done.  Thanks for the comment.

&gt; Are there measurements made on the installed base of 
&gt; Firefox like what is done for memory usage ?

There is a whole project for memory usage called MemShrink here:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink

There are a lot of other measurements as well and telemetry data for those that enable it.  This enables us to see problems that aren't on the machines of the developers.

There are few things more frustrating than trying to interact with a nearly unresponsive Firefox (or a Firefox that's responsive for a few seconds, then grinds to a halt while more I/O goes on). So I don't think it's a very good idea to create the illusion that the program has finished launching when it hasn't.

Mind you, I haven't been in a position to test Firefox like this in a while. Hopefully with all the optimizations that have been made in the past half year or so, launching Firefox on my college's PCs has become much smoother (one of the problems is that their virus scanner seems to want to scan everything on my USB stick the moment I read anything from there; it's very frustrating and I doubt Firefox can do anything about it).</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://pearce.org.nz" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/903b1144ddbc6ea5738477aab25f8481?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://pearce.org.nz">Chris Pearce</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Does SPS work on non-main threads?

I found a nice way, by using the sysinternals RamMap utility. Before launching an exe, just do Empty Standby List in it.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

&gt; Last time I tried it (on mobile) it didn't..

I'm not sure about its implementation but I'm pretty sure that at least for Pseudostack mode it happens on the same thread as you add the statements on.
