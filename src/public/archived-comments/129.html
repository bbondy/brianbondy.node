Are we able to use XAML just for the Metro UI, and retain the existing XUL interface for the desktop UI?</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3945b84f1ff45079da96fa36a76bdda?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

If we use XAML it'll be very minimal and mostly just a frame that Direct X sits in.

Sure it is possible, but I wouldn't be the one doing that discussion with them.

&gt; So are we blocked from shipping the same code for ARM? 
&gt; Is Windows 8 for ARM going to emulate Apple-style lock-down

I don't think we have details on this yet.

&gt; Which of the 3 categories will Microsoft Office belong to? 
&gt; Or is the a fourth MS-only category.

I haven't heard so not sure, but I can say for sure not the third category I mentioned.
Some of the browser vendors got together last year here: http://goo.gl/kK08k and realized that IE10 was running outside of the Metro sandbox. Personally I think it would have been best to have a more generalized third category.

&gt; Are there also plans to support the ARM version of Windows 8

We would love to, I'm unsure if it will be possible at this time.
I mean that with no positive or negative connotation, I really have no idea.

It's too early in development to know 
for sure. There may be some technical restrictions and we haven't decided one way or the other if we really want it.  I personally do want it even know it comes with a set of problems.

Given that most businesses will resort to "traditional" desktop rather than metro, is there inter-operable differences in browser behavior?
Lastly, I did say, we should be able to download the FF 4 Metro in Mozilla's website, rather than just the windows marketplace/store or whatever. </p></li></ul>
