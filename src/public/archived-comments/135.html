That means, "commands" go on the bottom app bar, APP navigation elements go in the top bar (this does not include the URL box, which is a "command" to go to a particular web site). 

So, the URL box, back, forward, stop, reload, add-to-favorites, and pin to start commands should go in the bottom app bar (you can group them into popup menus or organize them however you like). 

Tabs should not be on the left side of the screen - instead they should be on the top app bar along with history/favorites/new-tab buttons. Having any non-content UI elements "docked" to the left or right side of the screen make it difficult to use your app on a touch-screen device, because those sides are reserved for the system (charms on the right, multi-tasking on the left). </p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

We are implementing a third application type called Metro style enabled desktop browsers.  They are basically Metro applications that run outside of the sandbox. 

&gt; In the final version, please use proper metro app design guidelines...

We are aware of the guidelines, the screenshots are of the earliest working browser code and have none of the planned UX implemented yet.  As mentioned in the article the screenshots do not reflect a final product, the UI will be changing.

I have a few questions.
1) Will the add-ons work in metro-mode?
2) Will the metro style browser allow plug-ins such as flash?</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

Lion integration is being worked on as part of another project by different people, independent of this project. 
I hear your point though and that team is working to improve support.

&gt; 1) Will the add-ons work in metro-mode? 

Yes I think many (possibly most) will.

&gt; 2) Will the metro style browser allow plug-ins such as flash? 

This is still an open question.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b7d397d92dc19b6300801ba16bcf36d?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">Chris</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Is there a plan to offer a way for web developers to identify the Metro version of Firefox compared to the "classic" Firefox we know and love today?

I think the answer is no since we run outside of the sandbox and can deliver the app via normal means, but this could change.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/278fcd1e35c8cfa728bb1dd278508501?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">foggytown</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Thank you for this post and for taking time out to answer people's questions.

I really hope there's an x86 version. From what I understand Fx for Metro will be entirely chromeless, which I'd hate to see anyone on an x86 architecture do without.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://damn.org.za/blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0849109e47f90878a7b65db046c8607d?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://damn.org.za/blog">Eugene</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">@Rei I would settle for a decent Mac OSX Lion interface on Mac OSX...</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

I don't think so because at the moment when you set the desktop browser to Firefox or other browser instead of Internet Explorer you can no longer access the Metro version of Internet Explorer.
While on a tablet, you may end up using Internet Explorer with Metro first and not be able to switch to a browser without a Metro version, if you are on a desktop or laptop running Windows 7 and you upgrade to Windows 8 then make a different browser the default and it doesn't have a Metro version you can't use the IE10 Metro version either.
This is what happened to me when I installed Windows 8 CP, I installed Firefox and set it as the default browser and lost the ability to use the IE10 Metro app. When I clicked "Internet Explorer" on the Start Screen after that, it just ran the regular IE10 application.
This was really confusing at first as I wanted to use the regular Firefox and the IE10 Metro but regardless of my Internet Explorer settings, it would not work.
I finally figured out what Windows 8 CP was doing but Microsoft should have done a better job of telling you that if you have a default browser without a Metro version then you have no Metro Web Browser.
This gave me a bad impression of Metro and IE10 because I thought something was broken. Thus if the goal was to prop up IE10 then they not only did the opasite in this case but give me a bad impression of IE10 when I already didn't care for IE9.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12066cbfd8fce49065b384d49de5e707?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">Pluto</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">You guys are awesomeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
