You mentioned having the address bar on the top. All the Metro IE screenshots I've seen have it on the bottom. Is this an intentional deviation from the platform standard?

Yes that's correct.

&gt; All the Metro IE screenshots I've seen have it on the bottom. 
&gt; Is this an intentional deviation from the platform standard?

Yes this is intentional.

&gt; What is our (hopefully significantly justified) motivation in that?

You'd have to ask someone from the UX team but I don't think there is a conflicting Metro guideline.  Typically URL bars are on the top so IE is having the deviation here. 


&gt; Is it as simple as just double clicking FF's 
&gt; exe after you've built it?

Clicking the FF tile actually from the start screen.  You can find more info here:
