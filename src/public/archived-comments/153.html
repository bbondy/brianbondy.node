I have problem, there is no shortcut for Firefox metro on Start screen.
I tried everything uninstalled Nightly and all other Firefox versions(completely). There is no way to create shortcut.
Only way I can run Firefox Metro by opening links from other apps, Mail app for example.
I can open Metro Firefox from other apps, just there is no regular shortcut for it.
Is this known bug or what?

Maybe the problem is I had previous versions of elm builds installed. Maybe earlier elm builds changed something in registry and now new builds can't create shortcut?</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

Some things to keep in mind:
- You need to use windows 8 RTM or later
- If you had old builds installed, you can cleanup your registry by running the attachment in this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794433
- If you ever hid your shortcut, you can use the search screen to find the shortcut, and then right click on it and pin it back to your start screen.
- You can try setting the default through Firefox preferences, this will re-add a shortcut to your start screen.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2454af9b60007ce185faa66a87f57889?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">tom jones</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">why isn't that Future Releases blog on planet.mozilla.org?

Installed, set default to Nightly, but it's only opening the desktop edition. Touching the tile on the Start screen switches to the desktop, pulls up Nightly there. Any ideas what's happening? I'm running in a VMware Fusion 5 VM...just built a new Windows 8 RTM Eval VM and same behavior. IE10, no longer being default, shows same symptoms, of course, so it seems like a Default Browser issue of some sort.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2454af9b60007ce185faa66a87f57889?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">tom jones</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">no comments are probably on purpose, but i'm willing to bet the p.m.o is probably a mistake. about once a month i come upon a new(-ish) mozilla blog that is not there, and when i report it, it always gets added..

anyway, forgot to say the build looks and feels great! (right at home in metro), except for some sluggishness and the obvious missing features like mouse scroll and pinch to zoom.

also, love the simplified "draft" icon, and vote for it to stay way for the final release, maybe even for the browser on FirefoxOS! ;)</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://home.kairo.at/blog/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59d914ad47e5c3fcd4c89668adcd43a2?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://home.kairo.at/blog/">Robert Kaiser</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">tom jones: It's at p.m.o/projects (which had a bug for about a week and didn't update, but it does now), as the main p.m.o is for personal blogs only, and /projects is for blogs of projects.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://home.kairo.at/blog/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59d914ad47e5c3fcd4c89668adcd43a2?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://home.kairo.at/blog/">Robert Kaiser</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Gah, forget my last comment, I did get to it via the main p.m.o after all. ;-)</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

I find it ridiculous that IE Metro has flash support, but only on "white listed websites".

What gets me is that at first they weren't going to have flash at all because they said it eats up the batter. That turned out to be a bold faced lie, .02% is negligable "extra" consuption. So they retracted everything in their blog, and said "ok we'll support flash, but on our terms only."

Thank you Mozilla for keeping flash.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.
