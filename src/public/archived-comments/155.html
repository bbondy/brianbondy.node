First of all, cant wait for metro firefox to go live (and to gain extensions - lastpass!).
While I can see the advantages that sharing a profile will bring the limitation of only having one browser or another open at a time kind of defeats the point for me...
I want to use firefox on the desktop when i'm doing things on the desktop, but when i'm in a Metro app (say an RSS reader) and click a link i want to stay in "metro" and so open modern firefox..

From what you say above this would not be the case &amp; I would get kicked out to my desktop or have to manually close the desktop version and go back into metro...

This sounds far from ideal, I think i'll have to resort to forcing metro FF to use a different profile and stick to using "sync" - which icidentally has worked very well for me so far...</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f3f79b3fe10f621da07a524b76aadb2?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">Caspy7</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Is it possible in the future that both can run simultaneously?

That is, allow using one profile simultaneously in Desktop and Metro Firefox, using crazy IPC things to pipe profile data over.  I guess the current IPC architecture as I understand it, i.e. one chrome process for all windows, will make this difficult...

(I don't think your spam filter is working very well; I think 2 of 4 comments are junk.)</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianabondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianabondy.com">Brian R.

This is something I hope to cover in the Firefox Options after the initial task is out the door.
It would be helpful if you could post your exact usecae to a bug here:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox%20for%20Metro

&gt; Is it possible in the future that both can run simultaneously?

I'd love for that to be the case one day.
I think if we would have launched the brower originally with 2 different profiles this would be a lot more complex.
There are still major challenges to be able to do that safely.

&gt; re: e10s would make shared profiles better

It's an interesting idea but I think that it would be hard to deign the pocess model to accomplish that.
It's a hard problem though, so who knows maybe that's the way it will go.</p></li></ul>
