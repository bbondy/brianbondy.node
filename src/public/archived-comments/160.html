Was just a fan (now I do contributions for B2G Gaia from time to time..), and I was following your blog posts about the development of Firefox for Metro. It was really a great journey. I can proudly call myself one of your fans Brian and I have too much respect for you and for what you've done in Mozilla. I wish you all the success my friend.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19c488ed9a647fe020e75eb638c7d0e7?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="">kang</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Hey Brian, sad to see you go.
