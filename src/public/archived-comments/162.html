Only Web browsers have the privilege to access both Win32 and WinRT APIs. It would defeat the point of the Windows Store if just anyone could make a desktop app than runs in the Modern environment.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0566752ce55a90dbb5f80cd4f79fe14?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian R.

(Tried it for some hours – than switched back to IE)
The list of open pages is on the top of the screen and not on the bottom like in EI.
In “tablet mode” I cannot use my thumbs to navigate them. 
I have to shift my grip, lift my arm and obscure the screen to reach them.
As a user interface expert I think this is a design flaw – a simple yet deal-breaking one for me.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e35cb4aa8c7c65759e4b86fdf88030a3?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="">Janne Miettunen</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">I tested the browser and ditched it because:
No flash support, so no internet TV services. 
This would have been fine if flash video would have been replaced with something like Chrome does in Android devices.
Also the UI is a mess, I'm referring to the start screen and how you include favorites to it.
Especially lack of flash support rendered it useless for me to use in a Media Center set up.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.brianbondy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d8644c0ad8d89635fca422dd6d3ab5?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.brianbondy.com">Brian Bondy</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">Thanks for sharing, useful feedback always helps.

The amount of users that tried vs stopped using the browser was not significant, but definitely exist.
The main problem was not high numbers that tapered off into low numbers, but just low numbers from the start.

Some news articles took this a bit out of context, but there are definitely a combination of reasons at play.
I identified 2 things Microsoft could fix to help third party browsers out, but it's possible that even having those changes could have led to the same fate.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><a href="http://www.mathies.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f647ca6375d6a9aa7b8b74dfece4f208?s=60" class="gravatar"></a></div><a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.mathies.com">Jim Mathies</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">I think it just comes down to the current breadth of the Windows tablet computing market. We designed a touch centric tablet browser but the number of devices sold thus far that fit that need is pretty small. I don’t think this is indicative of the success or failure of this market though, it’s just not taking off as fast as we hoped. In time though I bet it will, and we’ll probably end up revisiting our decision. The selection of devices continues to expand and improve, see for example the recently announced Thinkpad 8. Eventually I’d bet sales of these types of devices will rival that of iPad sales. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see, until then we can continue to tinker with the browser in it’s new project repo home.</p></li></ul>
