Unfortunately your forward declaration example does not seem to be demonstrating anything. main.cpp will compile just fine without the forward declaration in d.h.

Perhaps there is something missing from the example? I am interested because I have a rather large C++ project that I would love to speed the compile time up for.

You can see the benefit in a large header file that has a lot of things in it.  When header files include other header files you then have a lot of parsing that you don't need to do.</p></li><li class="comment-item"><div><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11244bcdcf7b4e27975b6aeedfcec866?s=60" class="gravatar"></div><a rel="external nofollow">Torkel</a><span> on </span><small>Monday, November 18, 2013 (09:11:02)</small><span> says: </span><p class="comment-text">@Jack Let say another part of the program/library (e.h) depends on d.h (but not c.h) and therefor includes it. Now you will get a compile error if the forward declaration is removed.</p></li></ul>
