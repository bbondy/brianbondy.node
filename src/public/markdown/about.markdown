#About

##General Information

I live in Windsor, Ontario, Canada where I lived (other than University) since I was born on March 01, 1981.

I spend most of my time reading various books, programming, and doing work. My greatest fields of interest are P2P, digital image processing, number theory, compression, and changing diapers.

I am a primarily a C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript software developer.

Other than work and geek things, I also spend a lot of time with my wife Shannon, and 3 sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher.

I used to work full time on Mozilla's Fireofx browser (2011-2014), I remain a Mozilla community member and contributor (Mozillian).

As of April 21, 2014 I work full time for an amazing company called Khan Academy.
