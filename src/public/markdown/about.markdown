Family is my "raison d'être".  My wife Shannon and I have 3 sons: Link, Ronnie, and Asher.

When I'm not working, I'm usually running while listening to audiobooks.
My longest runs were in 2019 with 2 runs just over 100 miles.

I am a professional C++, Python, Rust, Go, C#, and JavaScript software developer.
I like reading about new technologies and other nerdy things.

From 2015 onward, I co-founded [Brave Software](https://www.brave.com) with the guy that created Mozilla and JavaScript: Brendan Eich.
I'm serving as CTO and as a member of the board at Brave Software.

I used to work at some pretty cool places including Khan Academy, Mozilla, and Evernote.
