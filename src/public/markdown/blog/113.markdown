The [ROBOBAK][1] company which myself, Ben Puzzuoli, and Rob Puzzuoli co-founded, was acquired by [KineticD][7].  

VisionWorks Solutions Inc. which primarily worked on ROBOBAK was founded in 2003.  Likewise ACPANA dba KineticD was also founded in 2003.
 
You can read about it [here][2], [here][3], [here][4], [here][6], and [here][5].

I am now working for the new company and still hold shares in the new company.
