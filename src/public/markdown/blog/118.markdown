On July 6th, I will be going through a major change in my life: I’ll be leaving the company I co-founded and worked at for nearly a decade, and will be starting at Mozilla as a contractor.

I'm confident that the company I co-founded will continue to prosper under its new parent company, and I will be excited to hear about the company's success over time.

I'll leave behind many great memories, exciting projects, and extremely intelligent co-workers.

A few months ago, I was approached by a Mozilla technical recruiter and after careful consideration actually turned down the offer for contract work.  For several months, I was torn on whether to stay at my current comfy job, or to [step out of my comfort zone][2], and do what I've always wanted to do.

Several months later, reading [John Resig][3]'s (creator of jQuery) advice, I reconsidered and took the job.

> It’s been an incredible experience working with everyone at Mozilla.
> The company is easily one of the most developer-friendly organizations I can imagine, with some of the smartest coders in the world.
> Mozilla is hiring across the board – I strongly encourage you to apply if you’re looking for one of the best jobs you’ve ever had.

I'll be working as a contractor at Mozilla with the title of Platform Engineer.  I'll be working on Firefox and Core components which includes working with XPCOM, XUL, XBL, JavaScript, CSS, Python, and C++.  I feel very privileged to be working on such an exciting project.

##Why I chose Mozilla

A few reasons why I chose Mozilla:

- Much of the web's technology and innovation was developed at least in part by Mozilla.
- The Internet wouldn't be what it is today without Mozilla.
- They are a relatively small and open source organization; your work will be seen.
- They support openness and stand behind their beliefs to deliver a free and open web.
- Some of the smartest people in the world work there, my old company also had this, but the other people had similar backgrounds to me.
- Firefox has a significant market share and is used by millions of people around the world.
- Mozilla has a thriving extremely intelligent community behind it.
- They are not forcing me to move and they embrace a distributed team.
- They do what is right, and not what makes the most money.
- I get to be part of something larger than myself.
- Mozilla is one of the coolest places and code bases I could ever have the privilege to work on and contribute to.

Mozilla is accelerating their release cycle as well which is exciting in itself.  Firefox 4 was released in early 2011, and they plan to also release versions 5, 6 and 7 in 2011.

If you are a developer interested in contributing to Mozilla related technologies, a good place to start is the [Developer Guide][1].  If you'd like to find out more [about pursuing a career at Mozilla, read here][4].
