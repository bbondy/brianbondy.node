Introducing:
##[The Mozilla Platform Development Cheat Sheet][1].

Working on Firefox can be daunting when you first start as a developer.  

There is an amazing amount of Mozilla specific technology you need to learn; in addition you may not have had the opportunity to work with things like [mercurial patch queues (MQ)][4].

On one hand: Mozilla has a massive collection of awesome [Mozilla development specific documentation][3] on the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)][5].

On the other hand: There is a massive collection of documentation that you have to keep looking up.

When I started as a platform developer at Mozilla 3 months ago, I started making a [cheat sheet of common information][1] I would have to frequently look up.
I will continue to update this page as I continue to learn every day at Mozilla.

I highly encourage anyone looking to contribute to an open source project to look into [contributing to Mozilla][2].

Not only will you be helping an open source non-profit organization, but you will also connect with extremely smart peers, have extra resume flair, and learn a ton.  The experience of contributing ([or working][6]) for Mozilla will forever change you as a developer.
