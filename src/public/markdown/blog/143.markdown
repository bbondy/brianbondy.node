Two weeks ago I wrote [this tweet][3] that generated over 1500 link clicks alone, as well as several retweets with different untracked links.

In this [blog post][2] I mentioned that actions speak louder than words and asked Microsoft to show us their commitment to open source.

I'm happy to say that today [Microsoft announced][1] that they listened to user feedback and will now be offering a Visual Studio Express for Desktop applications.

Not having a Visual Studio Express for Desktop applications would have had a negative impact on open source.  Thanks to everyone who retweeted and voted!
