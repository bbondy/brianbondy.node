About a year and a half ago, Priya Patel reached out to me and offered me a position as a contractor.  I [eventually accepted and started work][118] on July 6th 2011 under [Benjamin Smedberg][6].  

I put my heart and soul into it, and a couple months later I was offered a full time position. I started working as an employee under [Robert Strong][7] as my manager.

**Early concerns:**

I was initially offered a position as a contractor for a 3 month term and no guarantee of anything past that. I was coming from a salaried position with benefits, and since I had twin 2 year old boys, this scared the !#$#!% out of me.  I knew the personal growth opportunities at Mozilla exceed those at my current position though, so I decided to take a chance.

**Retrospection:**

I'm happy to say that when looking back, I'm glad I took the risk, and consider it to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.  I've had an amazing year.

Mozilla's values and principles are aligned with my own.  They allow me to be open about what I work on.  Hundreds of millions of people get to see my work, and I feel like I am not constrained in any way.  

The people I work with are awesome, each in their own way, and I have an implicit trust in each of their abilities.  QA, support, other developers, project managers, product managers... they've all taught me so much over the past year.

**What I've completed over the past year:**

Over the past year, not including any of the completed Windows 8 Metro work, I've pushed over 215 patches across over [170 resolved/fixed bugs][2].

I've also [filed 200 bugs][200bugs] that need to be, or have been done.

I'm a [module peer][3] for [Firefox, Toolkit, ImageLib, and Widget|Win32][4].  I've done a ton of reviews and [mentored][5] several bugs.  I'm also a member of the [coding stewards][10] group. 

Here's a list of some of the larger things I've completed over the past year:

- A ton of [Windows 8 Metro work][win8work]
    - Initial ground work along with Jim Mathies
    - Graphics code integration
    - Metro file picker
    - Metro contracts
    - Dozens of other tasks
- Updater work:

    - Security enhancement to the updater process, with and without the service.
- [Startup performance tasks][127] under the [Snappy project][8].
- Dozens of platform integration tasks to better integrate with Windows
- Jump list icons generated from favicons
- ImageLib work:
    - BMP encoder

**Where I'd like to go from here:**

<img src='/static/img/blogpost_118/mozilla-logo.png' style='float:right;padding-left:2px;'>

As part of the coding stewards program, I'm starting work on a project to bring videos for code contributors.  The plan is to have short 5-10 minute videos that each cover a single topic.  This would be similar to Khan Academy videos in the 1 video per concept way, but will be more like a tutorial and will be focused on contributing to Mozilla. 
 
In my past job I managed a team of developers and I expressed interest in doing this at Mozilla.

Lastly I want to continue doing what I'm already doing, I love making a difference and getting things done.
