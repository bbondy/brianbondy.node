As <cite>Deb Cohen (VP, Chief of People)</cite> said:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Our goal this year is to find new ways for people to become part of us.
This year we have a very aggressive goal, for all of us to look inside our teams, our work, our organization, and create some of these pathways.

## What is Code Firefox?

The [Code Firefox site][0] ([@codefirefox][codefirefoxtwitter]), is a new video and exercise framework which is highly inspired by [Khan Academy][KA].  Its purpose is for on-boarding contributors and sharpening the skills of existing community members.  

People learn differently. Providing different ways to consume information is crucial to growing Mozilla.  For many people, Code Firefox provides an easier, and more consumable approach to learning how to contribute to Mozilla.

## Testimonial

One prime example of Code Firefox's usefulness is of a new contributor who joined last month, and actively uses Code Firefox.
He has already [submitted 18 patches][1].

## Code Firefox statistics


<a title='Visits per region' href='/static/img/blogpost_158/stats.png'><img src='/static/img/blogpost_158/stats.png' width=300 style="float:right; margin-left: 15px"></a>

The site has not been promoted yet, but it already has:

- ~46,000 unique visits since it was released on October 30, 2013
- ~10,000 full video views across the 53 videos
- Most functionality is available without accounts, but there are still over 110 Code Firefox accounts and 35 YouTube subscribers.  Most of these accounts are new Bugzilla users as well and several have patches.

## What our community is saying

- <cite>Robert O'Callahan (Distinguished Engineer)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
In all my years with Mozilla I've never seen such an exciting effort to engage new Firefox contributors. Well done!</q>


- <cite>Josh Matthews (Community Engagement Lead)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
To me, Code Firefox's value lies in the clear, forthright instruction provided, along with the bite-sized nature of the lessons, which provides a counterpoint to the existing long-winded and slightly overwhelming textual documentation. I have interacted with countless potential volunteers over the past several years, and there is a non-trivial segment of the population that immediately looks for instructional videos to aid in understanding. In addition, perhaps counter-intuitively, video explanations are often preferred by non-native English speakers as a visual reference to aid in comprehension, and I'm often asked at events whether these exist for Firefox development.
</q>


- <cite>Chris Peterson (Engineering Program Manager)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">Facebook has its infamous bootcamp for new employees. Code Firefox should be required watching, end-to-end, for all new Mozilla engineers. Even non-engineers can benefit from the introductory videos.  Given the positive community response and patches to prove it, Brian has shown that this e-learning format works. More than just lessons, Brian has built Code Firefox as a platform. I would love to see other Mozilla teams contribute videos for their feature areas. Even within Mozilla we have some technology silos that could learn from each other.</q>


- <cite>Lukas Blakk (Senior Release Manager)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Getting into Open Source contribution is not always a clear path.  In my experience, it took me 4 different attempts (MDN, Sumo, QA, AMO) before I found my path for a deeper dive and got 'hooked' on contributing to Mozilla.  These videos and the technical mentorship they provide is already proving to be a valuable resource for engaging new coders and that is an area that can be hardest for a newcomer to break into alone since we are now such a legacy project.  Fortunately Code Firefox is also a budding online community and that ensures no one is ever truly alone as they move up in their learning. Having someone (or several people) getting to focus more time on this particular pathway will ensure more robust community surrounds our software products and makes what we give back a product that is a reflection of that wider community. Win-win.</q>

- <cite>Jared Wein (Firefox Engineer)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Code Firefox is an amazing site that is full of detailed, finely-crafted videos that guide interested people from being Firefox users to Firefox contributors. It is an invaluable tool and one that I wished was around when I was just getting started contributing to Firefox. Projects the size of Firefox can be very daunting and scary to newcomers. The tutorials on the site bring a level of comfort not found in many other places, and walk people through steps at a pace that they can handle. Before they know it they are knee deep in a great community of people who are working together to make Firefox and the Internet a better place for everyone.</q>

- <cite>David Boswell (Community Engagement Lead)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Code Firefox and other efforts to help support coding contributors are crucial to growing and empowering new members of the Mozilla community.</q>


- <cite>Kamil Jozwiak (QA Engineer)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Code Firefox has helped me out tremendously while I was contributing to Mozilla. It helped me complete my first patch and it's an amazing resource to sharpen your skills. I'm a Code Firefox lifer and visit the site on a daily basis to see if anything new has been added. I really believe in this project and I know from first hand experience how powerful this resource can be in helping people interested in the Mozilla mission.</q>


- <cite>Rodrigo Silveira (Firefox Engineer)</cite>:
<br>
<q lang="en-us">
Getting started with contributing to any code base can be daunting. Code Firefox videos are presented in such a friendly way that makes contributing to Firefox a lot more approachable. Being able to learn through video at your own pace is convenient too, you can get from zero to landing patches much faster. I liked it so much I had to help translate it so more people could benefit.</q>
