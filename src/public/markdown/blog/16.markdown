Every version of windows allowed each application to stop the computer from entering sleep mode.

This is an important function and is required by several applications (for example backup software). This ability was removed in Windows Vista. I.e. Windows Vista (without manual tweaking of a group policy) does not allow an application to veto sleep mode.

This is just another reason why Windows Vista sucks.
