The most important rule to writing great easy to understand emails, is simply that: Writing is not a linear process.

Read the email over, add to your email, spend time on your email, cut your email up into sections.

Replace words like "it" with the object that you are talking about. Your readers will probably have no clue what you're referring to in your email.

Reading is a linear process. Writing is not. It's really that simple.
