February 5th 2009 my twin boys were born.

Ronald Brian Bondy was born at 4:34pm and weighed 5 pounds 11 ounces.
Lincoln Edward Bondy was born at 4:35pm and weighed 5 pounds 10 ounces.

Both boys are home now and are both doing well. Ronnie has gained almost 2 pounds from his birth weight and Link has gained over 1 pound since his birth weight.

Myself I'm as proud as ever and love them to pieces.
