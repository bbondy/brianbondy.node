I have an Apple 30" cinema display and new Mac Book Pro Laptop. The 30" cinema display has a max resolution (which I use) of: 2560x1600. The screen is huge and is sure to give me a huge productivity boost for my work. The price tag on the 30" apple display is around 2k USD, but over time it'll pay for itself. I'm extremely happy with it. Ever since I got an iMac several months ago, I will never go back to PC hardware. Everything is bright, nice, fast, and overall just plain better with Apple.
