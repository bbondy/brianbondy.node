IE 7 is finally out to the public and out of beta. I wonder if it will effect firefox's market share, or the rate of increase of firefox's market share. If i had to bet i would say that it will slightly slow the rate of increate of firefox's market share. So my guess is that firefox will continue to gain market share.
