Yahoo! and MSN, along with others in the search market, had the chance to buy youTube, but they let Google scoop it up for the small amount of 1.65 billion. Just another example of Google being a great company, they seen that video is becoming a huge part of the Internet and the Internet's future, and they decided to become #1 at it by buying youTube. iTV by apple is coming out first quarter of 2007, and i would bet that this has a lot to do with Google. Live streaming from Google's youTube to iTV? I think so...
