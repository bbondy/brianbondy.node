We're starting to see more and more contests which propel technology beyond their current boundaries. In these contents, an objective is given which has never been accomplished, and a cash prize is given for the first person or team of people to figure out the objective. This is a great thing, and wealthy people should be doing this same thing for their fields of interest. In 10 years or so, I plan to setup some similar prizes. It?s a good way to make your life useful and help advance civilization. I believe that this type of prize system will only increase in the future. It will become people?s full time careers to pursue some of these breakthroughs, or be sponsored by a company that is pursuing them. A good example of this is the Ansari X prize. Other more recent examples are the Hutter prize for compression human knowledge, and the anti-aging research prize.
