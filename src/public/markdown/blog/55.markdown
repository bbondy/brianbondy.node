I signed up to be notified when I could join writely. I never got an invite. Today I went to lost password and it seems that it bypasses the wait for a new account. It emailed me a pass that I used with my email to access Writely. If anyone needs an invite, please try the above. If it doesn't work, just email me and I can invite you.
