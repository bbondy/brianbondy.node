I installed Ubuntu Linux, and I'm very impressed with it. I previously tried to install Fedora Core 5, Fedora Core 5 had problems with starting up (would hang at udev loading), after a few hours when I got in, my sound and network didn't work. I installed Ubuntu, the installation for Ubuntu took about 5 minutes, and everything worked including my internet with no configuration. It looks really cool and fast too. I would highly suggest to get Ubuntu if you want to install Linux.
