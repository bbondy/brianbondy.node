I've been starting to learn programming on my apple computer. The cool thing is that all dev tools on Mac are free unlike in windows. The bad part is that it is quite a bit different from programming Win32 :(. I guess maybe i should be using Carbon (Which is more for porting applications from C++). Apple claims that they will be updating both Cocoa and Carbon as time goes on equally.
