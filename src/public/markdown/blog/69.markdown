Added a new section available [here][1] which allows you to keep track of your non static IP address via a user defined host name. You can use the SOAP Dynamic DNS API to update your IP address periodically, as well as check what the IP address is via the API. You can also simply use the form on the Dynamic DNS page to access the IP address of your host name.
