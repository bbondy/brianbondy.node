Several months ago I decided that this website needed a revamping.  

The work since that thought is finally being released today.  The work on the site is still slowly in progress, but I feel that enough of the site is done to be better than the last site.

[![Powered by Django][9]][8]

Some stats on the new site:

-  Was developed on my mac
-  Was written using vi for all editing
-  Was built using [Django][4] 1.1
- Is running with [Python][5] 2.6
- Is served through IIS with [PyISAPIe][6].   (PyISAPIe is a great project created by Phillip Sitbon which brings Django to IIS.)
- [JQuery][10] was used for a couple of post page served alterations
- The database is built using [SQLite][12]
- The blog posts with code samples are made with [Google's code prettify][13]
- All blog posts are rendered using [Django Markdown][2] (which makes for easy posting of great content)

[Markdown][3] is a hassle free, easy to use markup language that allows you to easily post links, post images, and format great blog posts with little work.

[The old site][11] was built in ASP .NET beta, and slowly upgraded over time to newer versions.
Overall for me, coding in Django is a much better and funner experience than coding in ASP .NET ever was.

Before deciding on Django for the new site, I also had an attempt at [Ruby on Rails][7].  I wasn't a fan from the start, the language was simply too different from what I am used to and know.

I like the new design a lot better than the old one.  I hired [Bradd Bezaire to do this design][1] over 2 years ago in August of 2007.  This design sat in my inbox since then because I've been extremely busy, but I'm glad his work didn't go to waste after all.
