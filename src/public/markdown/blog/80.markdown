The [PyISAPIe][1] help files currently claim you have to use Python 2.5 and uses Django pre 1.0.

But with some small changes to one of the config files, you can actually have Django 1.1 and Python 2.6.

The only change from their help file that you need to do is replace their [pyisapie.py with this file that I modified][2].
