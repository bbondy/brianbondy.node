July 1st 2010 I was happy to receive an email from Microsoft notifying me that I won one of the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional][1] awards.   Specifically I was awarded for Visual C++. 

From the award website:

> The Microsoft MVP Award recognizes exceptional technical community leaders from around the world who voluntarily share their high quality, real world expertise with others. Microsoft MVPs are a highly select group of experts representing technology's best and brightest who share a deep commitment to community and a willingness to help others. Worldwide, there are over 100 million participants in technical communities; of these participants, there are fewer than 4,000 active Microsoft MVPs.

The award is well known and recognized in the tech industry and I'm very honored to have received it. 

The award comes with many perks but the recognition and other MVP contacts that you make are invaluable. 

It seems that the primary reasons for winning the award was for contributions to stackoverflow (Q&A site for programmers), my blog website, MSDN related forums, and codeproject (Q&A)
