# Books

## What the list contains

The list below is incomplete but contains some books that I considered good books that cover the topic they intended to nicely. If you are interested in the topics, I recommend that you read them. The date next to the books is not the published date, but the date that I read them. They were relevant to technology in that year, maybe not anymore today.
