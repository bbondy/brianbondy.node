##Lossless data compression

The focus of this section will be on lossless data compression, which is my interest.

Lossless data compression allows the exact reconstruction of data from its compressed source. Lossless data compression is used in many areas such as zip and gzip arbitrary data.

##Lossy data compression

Lossy data compression typically performs better than lossless data compression; however, it does not reconstruct an exact representation of the data. Some places where lossy data compression is useful is in images, video, and music.
