# Khan Academy

## Work

I worked at Khan Academy for just over a year between 2014 and 2015.

## Firefox OS Khan Academy app

During the period of time that I worked there, I had a side personal project for creating an app for Firefox OS.
You can see the [source code](https://github.com/bbondy/khan-academy-fxos) for that app or view it on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/khan-academy/).
It has over 14 reviews and is rated 5 out of 5 stars.

## Windows Modern UI Khan Academy app

I did a significant amount of contributions to the Khan Academy Modern UI Windows Store app.
You can get the [source code](https://github.com/Khan/khan-windows-8) here.
