# Projects

Listed below are some of the projects I've worked on throughout my career.  Some are full-fledged products, and some are just libraries.  Some I'm the primary developer (e.g. most things below) and some I've just contributed to (e.g. Link Bubble).

### [Brave OS X, Windows, and Linux browser](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop)

### [Link Bubble Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkbubble.playstore&hl=en)
Link Bubble makes the Android mobile web more efficient. When you click on a link in any app, Link Bubble loads that webpage in the background and presents it in a floating bubble, leaving you free to continue using your current app.
Unique amongst Android web browsers, it saves precious time normally spent watching pages load.

### [brianbondy.com](https://github.com/bbondy/brianbondy.node)
The current website you're visiting.  This website is written in Node, Hapi, Redis React, and ES6 transpiled with Babel.
This website has been redone several times before.  Previous versions were written in [Google App Engine](https://github.com/bbondy/brianbondy.gae), Django, ASP .NET (C#), Flash / ActionScript, and the original one was generated from C++ code.
Only the last couple sites were open source.

### [Brave Ad Block Engine (C++)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abp-filter-parser)
Adblock Plus filter parsing and matching for lists like EasyList.
This library allows users to prevent page elements, such as advertisements, from being downloaded and displayed.
It is an implementation of AdBlockPlus' filter rules. This library is in no way affiliated with Adblock Plus.
It just parses the same rules as Adblock Plus does.  It does it significantly faster than other adblock implementations.
