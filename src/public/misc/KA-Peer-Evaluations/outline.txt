Peer review at KA and hold it next Thursday

Key stats:
- Launched over 30 days ago
- Over 35,000 evaluation requests
- Over 4,000 unique reviewers
- Most people do 1-2 evaluations, but we have new evaluators all the time.
- 66% of evaluations are successful evaluations
- People are waiting about 2 days on average for a review, but because of the way we sort some are waiting 5 days. These numbers are expected to imrpove.

Who can evaluate:
- We initial set the bar very high, you had to complete the entire Intro to JS course to evaluate.
This lead to a massive amount of evaluation requests and not a lto of people to do them.
We since changed it to the user only has to complete a single challenge.

Quality of evalutions:
- We haven't seen a major problem in the quality of evaluations when we dropped the bar for who can evaluate.


The major battle has been making sure we have enough evaluators.  Only 20% of evals were being evaluated.
We added a lot of things at key points in the work flow to continually bring in new evaluators over time.
For example after you request an evaluation, it asks you to try your own.
After you receive an ealuation on yoru project, it asks you as well.
After you perform an evaluation, it asks you if you'd like to perform another.
